# teaching_ressources
A great list of resources for ecological and environmental statistics :)

## Quick look
Copy the docs folder and open index.html

## Contribute
library: distill, rmarkdown

## Questions to be discussed
- Standardization of tables of resources and automatisation of the site? Do we want to add resources in a database and then include code function to do the resources table in each part?
    - ***Floriane***: PRO: 1) it will be more standardized, 2) easier to include a friendly formulaire to fill-in for short and quick contribution, 3) easier and quicker to make functions that automatically update trees and main table of contents if the site become very popular. CON: 1) take a bit of time to set up the functions 2) will make the collaboration harder for new contributors, more time to learn how the website works... So maybe not a good idea. For now my opinion is to keep simple markdown tables but if the site grow it can become hard to handle it.
    - ***Olivier***: I agree, keep it simple so that others can contribute easily.
