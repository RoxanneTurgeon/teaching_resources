# teaching_ressources
A great list of resources for ecological and environmental statistics


## Quick look

copy the docs folder and open index.html

## Contribute

There are three main parts (Basics, Modelling, byField) containing each a number of modules. The idea for now is to create one page/article by module named "partname_modulename.Rmd". For instance, the module R in the part Basics can be edited from [basics_r.Rmd](basics_r.Rmd)". You can create the .Rmd for the module you want to edit if not created yet.

I also created the [others.Rmd](others.Rmd) file to add interesting links that we do not know where to include.

## To Be Done:
-a simple way to update home (index.Rmd)
-search bar does not work
