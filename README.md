# teaching_ressources
A great list of resources for ecological and environmental statistics :)


## Quick look
Copy the docs folder and open index.html

## Contribute
library: distill, rmarkdown

There are three main parts (Basics, Modeling, byField) containing each a number of modules. The idea for now is to create one page/article by module named "partname_modulename.Rmd". For instance, the module R in the part Basics can be edited from [basics_r.Rmd](basics_r.Rmd). You can create the .Rmd for the module you want to edit if not created yet.

I also created the [others.Rmd](others.Rmd) file to add interesting links that we do not know where to include.

## To be done:
- a simple way to update home (index.Rmd) or add links...
- search bar does not work
- make a template page if needed
- update read me to contribute

## Questions to be discussed
- General organization: Who updates what, who checks what? what do you want (or you think you will have time) to do?
    - ***Floriane***: I included some possibilities to add one person in charge for each page that should check what is uploaded on it, organize the page and solicit people to contribute to the page. We need also someone to coordinate the global site and check that pages are coherents and not repetitives. I can do that but Sandra or Gilles you might also want to do it?

- General presentation and tree of each page?
    - ***Floriane***: #Overview courses #then more specific tree with specific resources? Do we add more guidelines sentences and with which structure?

- How do we present scientific articles (using full references or not)? 
    - ***Floriane***: For now I only copy title and first author but this might be optimized using cite. And related to that how far do you want to add functions doing the page layout directly (such as the ilink() function I did). I like to have this kind of functions but it will make life harder I guess for contributors, so maybe not a good idea. My opinion is to keep basic markdown tables for the layout.
