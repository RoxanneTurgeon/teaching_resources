# teaching_ressources
A great list of resources for ecological and environmental statistics :)

## Quick look
Copy the docs folder and open index.html

## Contribute
library: distill, rmarkdown

There are three main parts (Basics, Modeling, byField) containing each a number of modules. The idea for now is to create one page/article by module named "partname_modulename.Rmd". For instance, the module R in the part Basics can be edited from [basics_r.Rmd](basics_r.Rmd). You can create the .Rmd for the module you want to edit if not created yet.

I also created the [others.Rmd](others.Rmd) file to add interesting links that we do not know where to include.

## Questions to be discussed
- General organization: Who update what, who check what? what do you want (or you think you will have time) to do?
    - ***Floriane***: I included some possibilities to add one person in charge for each page that should check what is uploaded on it, organize the page and solicit people to contribute to the page. We need also someone to coordinate the global site and check that pages are coherent and not repetitive. I can do that but Sandra or Gilles you might also want to do it?
    - ***Olivier***: Pull requests would be great, and for those who're not familiar with Git, a formulaire to fill in to add stuff. On my side, happy to keep an eye on things, but I guess we'll have to come up w/ an editorial policy. My experience with our Facebook page <https://www.facebook.com/groups/464518943663021> is that when the place gets some visibility, you start getting unsollicitated contributions of poor and/or irrelevant quality

- General presentation and tree of each page?
    - ***Floriane***: #Overview courses #then more specific tree with specific resources? Do we add more guidelines sentences and with which structure?
    - ***Olivier***: I like the idea of trees. I guess we can stick to it for now and see how it goes, and what folks think about it, like do they find it easy to navigate, to walk around, or find something specific. 

- Standardization of tables of resources and automatisation of the site? Do we want to add resources in a database and then include code function to do the resources table in each part?
    - ***Floriane***: PRO: 1) it will be more standardized, 2) easier to include a friendly formulaire to fill-in for short and quick contribution, 3) easier and quicker to make functions that automatically update trees and main table of contents if the site became very popular. CON: 1) take a bit of time to set up the functions 2) will make the collaboration harder for new contributors, more time to learn how the website works... So maybe not a good idea. For now my opinion is to keep simple markdown tables but if the site grow it can became hard to handle it.
    - ***Olivier***: I agree, keep it simple so that others can contribute easily. 
    
- Information to be presented per resource?
    - ***Floriane***: - book: Name, Author, year?, a short description
                      - article: Name, first Author, year? journal? vol-pages?,
                      - course: Name, Author, a short description
                      - website including blog and others: Name, author?, a short description
    - ***Olivier***: for article: Also, full ref would be great.
