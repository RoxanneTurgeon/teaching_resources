# teaching_ressources
A great list of resources for ecological and environmental statistics :)

## Quick look
Copy the docs folder and open index.html

## Contribute
library: distill, rmarkdown

There are three main parts (Basics, Modeling, byField) containing each a number of modules. The idea for now is to create one page/article by module named "partname_modulename.Rmd". For instance, the module R in the part Basics can be edited from [basics_r.Rmd](basics_r.Rmd). You can create the .Rmd for the module you want to edit if not created yet.

I also created the [others.Rmd](others.Rmd) file to add interesting links that we do not know where to include.

## Questions to be discussed
- General organization: Contributions?
    - ***Olivier***: Pull requests would be great, and for those who're not familiar with Git, a formulaire to fill in to add stuff. 

- Standardization of tables of resources and automatisation of the site? Do we want to add resources in a database and then include code function to do the resources table in each part?
    - ***Floriane***: PRO: 1) it will be more standardized, 2) easier to include a friendly formulaire to fill-in for short and quick contribution, 3) easier and quicker to make functions that automatically update trees and main table of contents if the site become very popular. CON: 1) take a bit of time to set up the functions 2) will make the collaboration harder for new contributors, more time to learn how the website works... So maybe not a good idea. For now my opinion is to keep simple markdown tables but if the site grow it can become hard to handle it.
    - ***Olivier***: I agree, keep it simple so that others can contribute easily. 
    
- Information to be presented per resource?
    - ***Floriane***: - book: Name, Author, year?, a short description
                      - article: Name, first Author, year? journal? vol-pages?,
                      - course: Name, Author, a short description
                      - website including blog and others: Name, author?, a short description
    - ***Olivier***: for article: Also, full ref would be great. 
    - ***Floriane & Sandra***: Keep it sample as it is title, author, description
    
## People to be contacted:

People that we know and that might be interested to be in charge of some parts:
S Cubaynes, V Miele, P de Villemeureuil, D Zeleny


## To be done:
- update read me to contribute for the in charge person and then for others & formulaire to fill /template
- send an email/- update general organization of folders (cf Stephane mail but what other think?)
- update/standardize presentation of articles and others
- automatically update index page once we have the organisation: for now we have to add pages and sections "by hand"
- add levels/icons in each page at the top or in the legend
